# Lending Club Case Study
> A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers receives loan applications, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
>
><li>If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
>
><li>If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company 

>The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc
